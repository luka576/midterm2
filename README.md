ListMapper Java Program
Overview
ListMapper is a Java program that demonstrates the use of lists and mappings to associate and transform data between two different types: integers and strings. The program performs the following tasks:

Creates two predefined lists:
list1 containing integers.
list2 containing strings.
Establishes a mapping between integer values and specific strings.
Uses the mapping to transform list1 into a third list (list3) of strings.
Filters the third list to retain only strings that occur more than once, creating a reduced result.
This project is great for learning about:

Java Collections (List, Map)
HashMaps for key-value mapping
Frequency counting and list filtering
Program Logic
Initialize Data:

list1: A list of 13 integers (some repeated).
list2: A list of 18 unique string values.
Mapping: A fixed mapping from integers in list1 to corresponding strings, some of which are in list2:

Transform: Generate list3 by replacing each integer in list1 with its mapped string value.

Reduce: From list3, create a reduced list that includes only values occurring more than once.
